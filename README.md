# PLAYER TWORDLE

This project is a version of the beautiful Wordle game created by Josh Wardle, playable here: https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html

This game, however, is different in that it allows two players (on the same device) to play together. The first player chooses a five letter word, and the second player tries to guess it in five (5) tries or less.

## This is a react app

I utilized the create-react-app structure found here: https://create-react-app.dev/

## This is, at this stage, merely the MVP.

Bear with me as I edit comments and refactor

## I've hosted the app using heroku's free hosting.
It may take a few seconds to load as the Dyno wakes up. Patience is a virtue!
